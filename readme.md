# Odoo 18 Custom Module Structure

Welcome to the **Odoo 18 Module Structure Boilerplate** repository!

This project provides a clean and reusable starting point for building custom modules in **Odoo 18**. If you're an Odoo developer or just getting started, this repository can help you structure your modules in a consistent and maintainable way.

## üß© Why Module Structure Matters in Odoo

Odoo is a powerful and modular ERP system. Each feature or customization is packaged as a module. Having a well-organized module structure:

- Ensures **readability** and **maintainability**
- Promotes **reusability** and **scalability**
- Helps teams **collaborate efficiently**
- Makes it easier to upgrade modules as Odoo evolves

This repository follows best practices aligned with the Odoo 18 framework and can be forked or cloned as a boilerplate for future projects.
